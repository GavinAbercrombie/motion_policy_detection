"A register of vehicles will be established which will allow purchasers of second hand vehicles to check that their intended purchase is legitimate.","605",NA
"The cost added to a purchase will be around £5.00 but the peace of mind afforded will be great.","605",NA
"Much police time is wasted for want of such simple and cost effective solutions:","303",NA
"much is also wasted in waiting for court appearances and the court system needs better resourcing.","303",NA

"The solution to the problem of crime in Scotland does not lie in more prisons and more mandatory sentences:","605",NA
"these proposals have been rejected by the judiciary and by most commentators and it is an indictment of government in the last decade that our prison population is at its highest ever level - and still rising.","605",NA
"What is needed is a range of alternatives to prison and a flexible sentencing policy coupled with schemes for education and rehabilitation that actually work.","605",NA
"To implement and operate  such schemes the justice system must be encouraged to learn from international best practice and the SNP proposes the establishment of a research and development facility within a Scottish University to develop and implement education and rehabilitation schemes.","605",NA
